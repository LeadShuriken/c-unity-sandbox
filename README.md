# C# And Unity Application Sandbox Samples # 

### DLS Concept App ###

* An aplication creating realtime blends of lights from scenes created "initially" with Dialux. 

* The unity aplication utilizes Dialux Scene files which are not in binary format and thus are interperted 
and moved to 3ds Max after which they are procedurally created in proper format with proper mapping for Unity.

* The app itself needs nothing but the assets to create the blends. (check python (crone jobs) and 
maxscript(GeometrySubAndConversion, DialuxToMax) for the other parts).

### Retail Store App ###

* A very simple app displaying a new light fixture which Philips produces (beam size change, intensity, direction).
The luminaire itself is incredible as it actuall produces all the effects with only lenses and very small motors.

### Dev Builds ###

* Devbuilds and C# code.
